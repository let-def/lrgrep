(** This module implements the regular expressions used by LRGrep.
    It provides functions for creating, comparing, and deriving regular
    expressions and continuations, which appear during the derivation process.
    It is parameterized by the `Info` and `Redgraph` modules, which are used to
    provide information about the LR automaton and its (viable) reductions,
    respectively. *)
