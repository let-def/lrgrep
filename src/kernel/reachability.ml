     by removing the other blocks from the universe T, see section 6.1).  The
     block that is omitted is one that is guaranteed to have infinite cost in
     the compact cost matrix.
     Therefore, we never need to represent the rows and columns that correspond
     to the missing class; by construction we know they have infinite cost.
     For instance for shift transitions, it means we only have a 1x1 matrix:
     the two classes are the terminal being shifted, with a cost of one, and

  (* Representation of matrix cells, the variables of the data flow problem.
     There will be a lot of them. Actually, on large grammars, most of the
     memory is consumed by cost matrices.

     Therefore we want a rather compact encoding.
     We use a two-level encoding:
     - first the [table] vector maps a node index to a "compact cost matrix"
     - each "compact cost matrix" is represented as a 1-dimensional array of
       integers, of dimension |pre_classes n| * |post_classes n|

     This module defines conversion functions between three different
     representations of cells:

     [Cell.t] identify a cell as a single integer
     <=>
     [Tree.n index * Cells.offset] identify a cell as a pair of a node and an
     offset in the array of costs
     <=>

     a node, a row index and a column index of the compact cost matrix
