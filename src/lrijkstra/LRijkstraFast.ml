  (* This module implements efficient representations of the coerce matrices,
     as mentioned in section 6.5.

     However, our implementation has one more optimization.
     In general, we omit the last block of a partition (it can still be deduced
     by removing the other blocks from the universe T, see section 6.1).  The
     block that is omitted is one that is guaranteed to have infinite cost in
     the compact cost matrix.
     Therefore, we never need to represent the rows and columns that correspond
     to the missing class; by construction we know they have infinite cost.
     For instance for shift transitions, it means we only have a 1x1 matrix:
     the two classes are the terminal being shifted, with a cost of one, and
     its complement, with an infinite cost, that is omitted.

     Our coercion functions are augmented to handle this special case.
