       There is no way to detect immediate match (empty (sub-)regex leading

       The case is handled by looking for [(empty_label, Done)] in the result
       list, where [empty_label] is a label capturing and filtering nothing
       (vars and ordering are empty, filter = Lr1.all).

       However, this does not allow to distinguish between the regular
       expressions ϵ and _ which will both lead to "Done" while matching no
       transitions.

       TODO not sure.
       To simplify the NFA a bit, we could normalize by splitting disjunctions
       before derivation.
