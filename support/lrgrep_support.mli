(* It is not necessarily the case that

   Since only valid LR stacks are expected to be matched, some transitions are
   impossible. This translates to a partial definition of transitions.
   The runtime behavior is undefined if an impossible transition is taken:
   the optimizer is free to chose the interpretation that suits it the most.
